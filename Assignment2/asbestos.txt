A
form
of
asbestos
once
used
to
make
Kent
cigarette
filters
has
caused
a
high
percentage
of
cancer
deaths
among
a
group
of
workers
exposed
to
it
more
than
30
years
ago
,
researchers
reported
.

The
asbestos
fiber
,
crocidolite
,
is
unusually
resilient
once
it
enters
the
lungs
,
with
even
brief
exposures
to
it
causing
symptoms
that
show
up
decades
later
,
researchers
said
.

Lorillard
Inc.
,
the
unit
of
New
York-based
Loews
Corp
that
makes
Kent
cigarettes
,
stopped
using
crocidolite
in
its
Micronite
cigarette
filters
in
1956
.

Although
preliminary
findings
were
reported
more
than
a
year
ago
,
the
latest
results
appear
in
today
's
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
,
a
forum
likely
to
bring
new
attention
to
the
problem
.
